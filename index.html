        <p>
            Hey! Thanks for stopping by my page. My name is Deepa, I am a recent graduate from Smith with a double degree in 
            CS and Mathematics. I care about utilizing emerging technologies with an ethnical lense and exploring the why and 
            how behind coding. I have taken subjects such as Data Structues & Algorithms, Computational Linear Algebra, 
            Mathematics behind Deep Learning, and government classes such as Law, Gender, & Policy.

        <h1> My Coding Journey in Fast Facts</h1>

        <ul>
            <li>I have coded on and off from a young age but I got serious about it when I did my first Kode With Klossy Camp in 2020!</li>
            <li>I participated in KWK's Mobile App Development Course and built Politfy! An app to learn about politician's and their views without bias</li>
            <li>Through college I took CS classes but felt incomplete. I realized I liked learning about the math behind algorithms as well so I majored in Math as well!</li>
            <li>In the summer of 2022 I was a full-stack developer at Tomorrowdragon, a e-commerce startup!</li>
            <li>In the summer of 2023 I was a Technology Leadership Development Intern at Travelers Insurance!</li>
            <li>From 2023 to 2024 I was a AI/ML Scholar at MIT through the Breakthrough Tech Program!</li>
            <li>In 2024, I studied abroad in Glasgow, Scotland and took classes in Mechanics and ROS Robotics.</li>
            <li>In my senior year I got into machine learning and built a object detection model to identify where enemies are located in video games to help 
                gamers with accessibility issues.
            </li>
            <li>After graduating, I am currently expanding my coding skills and keeping myself open to new opportunities!</li>
